/* Here We can write directly assign the Character value to the short.
==>But you cannot convert the short to char.
==>Because short is signed bit
==> It can hold Both Positive and Negative value.
/*This is because a short is capable of holding negative values while char isn't, as you might have seen from Character..*/
/*The reason that a cast is required is that, even though char and short are both 16 bits, a char is unsigned while a short is signed*/*/
