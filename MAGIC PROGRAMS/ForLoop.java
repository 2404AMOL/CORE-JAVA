//==>It Not mandtory to initailize the variable in the For Loop
//==>It also Not Mandotory to update the Condition in the For Loop
//Because before the for loop their is a while and do while loop
//So in the do and do while loop we can initiliaze the variable in the before the loop
//And we can update the condition in the loop.
